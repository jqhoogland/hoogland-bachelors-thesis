#### Abstract
Recent work has drawn attention to the links between statistical physics and machine learning (ML) and, in particular, to comparisons between the renormalization group (RG) and deep neural networks. These have inspired interest in the information-theoretic framework underpinning these fields and prompted an investigation towards a better theoretical understanding of RG. In this capstone, we introduce and expand upon these connections from the ground up. Starting with the basics of ML and RG, we work our way to an algorithm implementated on neural networks that learns optimal, model-independent RG procedures, the real-space mutual information (RSMI) algorithm of Koch-Janusz and Ringel (2018). Along the way, we review the current state of the literature and clarify misconceptions in earlier works. With the RSMI algorithm, we review a novel calculation of the Ising model critical exponent, and we generalize this approach to arbitrary lattice systems. We release an open-source library, rgpy, for implementing these novel procedures, and close with a discussion of the wide-ranging implications.
