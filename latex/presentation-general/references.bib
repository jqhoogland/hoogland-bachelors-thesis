abstract="In this chapter, we will discuss the tools required for calculating the effective action and for performing the RG improvement. We will start with some general considerations about dimensionality, divergences and renormalization. Afterwards, we will show the connection between quantum corrections and the beta functions that determine the RG flow. Then we will present the derivation of the effective action in the path integral formalism and discuss the Faddeev--Popov method in the case of gravity. Finally, we will outline the basic steps in the general Schwinger--DeWitt algorithm, in order to calculate the divergent part of the one-loop effective action.",
