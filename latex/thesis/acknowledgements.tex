\section*{Acknowledgements}
I would like to thank Marcos Crichigno for supervising this
capstone. I do not think either of us knew what we were getting into
when I first approached him, and I am stunned at how much I have been
able to learn during this time. Marcos provided guidance, much-needed
prodding, and a watchful eye, keeping the focus on the big
picture. The topics were new to both of us, ML for him and RG for me,
and getting to integrate these different perspectives was a wonderful
experience. I would also like to thank my dad, Jiri Hoogland, for
helpful feedback on drafts and, most of all, for his expertise on on
all things Monte Carlo. After being stuck with implementation details
of the RSMI algorithm for two weeks, his words finally let the penny
drop. As a last note, I would like to thank my friends and (other)
family for putting up with me during the last weeks (when I was a
little less than sociable), in particular, Nick van der Woude, for
mutually infectious enthusiasm.
